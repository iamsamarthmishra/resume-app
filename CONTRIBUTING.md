## Submitting Your Changes

Ready to make a contribution? Follow these simple steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repo by following [this guide](link here).
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Once you’ve forked it, clone your repo locally:
    ```bash
    git clone FORKED_REPO_URL
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project folder and run:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4. **Create a New Branch**: It’s a good practice to create a new branch for each change. Name it after the feature or fix you’re working on:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
    ```
5. **Run the Project**: Start up the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
6. **Make Your Edits**: Implement your changes, test them locally, and when you’re ready:
    1. **Commit Your Work**: Use a meaningful commit message:
        ```bash
        git commit -am 'Descriptive message of your changes'
        ```
    2. **Push Your Branch**: Push the branch to your fork:
        ```bash
        git push origin BRANCH_NAME
        ```
    3. **Open a Pull Request**: Head back to GitHub and [submit a pull request](link here). Be sure to target the `main` branch.

And that’s it! Our team will review your PR, and if everything looks good, we’ll merge it into the main branch.
